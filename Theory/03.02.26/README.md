# 03.02.26 – Docker Daemon & REST API (Class Work)

It is related to Docker daemon verification and basic interaction with Docker using its REST API.



### 1. Checked Docker socket
We first checked whether the Docker socket exists and is accessible.

Command used:
```bash
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
```
This showed that /var/run/docker.sock is linked to the Docker Desktop socket location, confirming that Docker daemon is running.

2. Pinged Docker daemon using curl
We used curl with the Unix socket to check if Docker is responding.

Command used:
```bash
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/_ping
``` 
Output:

OK
This confirmed that the Docker daemon is active and responding to API requests.

3. Checked Docker version via REST API
We retrieved Docker version details directly from the Docker API.

Command used:
```bash
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/version
```
This returned details like:

Docker Desktop version

Docker Engine version

API version

OS and architecture

4. Listed running containers using REST API
We checked if any containers were running using the containers API endpoint.

Command used:
```bash
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/v1.44/containers/json
```
The output was an empty list, meaning no containers were running at that time.
